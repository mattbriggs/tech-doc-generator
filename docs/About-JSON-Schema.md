# JSON Schema provides a way to validate JSON data

JSON Schema provides a way to validate JSON data. While JSON Schema has a comprehensive set of built-in validation keywords, sometimes you might want to add custom validations.

You can't directly add custom validation fields to the standard JSON Schema, but you can employ several strategies to achieve custom validation:

1. **Combining Existing Keywords**: JSON Schema's combination keywords like `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, and `not` allow you to craft complex validation rules. By using these in combination with other keywords, you can often achieve the custom validation you need.

2. **Use of `pattern` Keyword**: For string data, you can use regular expressions with the `pattern` keyword to implement custom validations.

3. **Annotations**: You can include custom fields in your schema to provide additional metadata about how the validation should be handled. While these won't have any effect on standard JSON Schema validators, a custom validator can be written to interpret these fields and apply additional checks.

4. **Custom Validator**: If the in-built keywords are insufficient, you can write your custom validator. This involves writing code that reads the schema, interprets custom fields, and validates the JSON data against them. This way, you can implement any validation logic you desire.

5. **Extensions**: Some JSON Schema validators support extensions or plugins, allowing you to introduce new validation logic directly into the validator.

Here's an example of what an annotation might look like:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "customField": {
      "type": "string",
      "customValidation": "myCustomRule"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, `customValidation` is an annotation that has no effect on standard JSON Schema validators. However, a custom validator could interpret the `customValidation` field and apply the `myCustomRule` validation logic to the `customField` property.

If you take the route of custom validation, always be aware that your schema might not be compatible with standard JSON Schema tools, and you will have to ensure your custom validator is available wherever the schema needs to be validated.
