# How to select or write a standard for a technical process

Selecting or writing a standard for a technical process is a systematic activity that requires clear understanding, collaboration, and documentation. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through this process:

### 1. **Define the Purpose**:
- What is the objective of the process?
- Who are the intended users or beneficiaries?
- How will the process impact the organization or system?

### 2. **Research Existing Standards**:
- Before creating a new standard, research to see if there are existing standards that can be adopted or adapted.
- Look at industry best practices, international standards, or guidelines from professional associations.

### 3. **Assemble a Team**:
- Gather a diverse team of experts who have knowledge of the technical process.
- Include representatives from all departments or teams that will be affected by the standard.

### 4. **Document Current Process**:
- If a process is already in place, document the current steps, tools, and methodologies.
- Identify pain points, inefficiencies, and areas of improvement.

### 5. **Draft the Standard**:
- Outline the steps of the process clearly and sequentially.
- Define roles and responsibilities for each step.
- Specify tools, equipment, or software required.
- Include safety or security protocols if necessary.
	  
### 6. **Validation and Testing**:
- Test the standard in a controlled environment.
- Gather feedback from the testers about clarity, effectiveness, and any potential oversights.

### 7. **Revise and Refine**:
- Based on feedback, make necessary revisions to the draft.
- It may require multiple rounds of revision and testing.

### 8. **Training and Implementation**:
- Once finalized, provide training to all relevant personnel.
- Ensure everyone understands the new standard and knows how to implement it.
	  
### 9. **Review Mechanism**:
- Set up periodic reviews of the standard to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
- Consider external factors like technological advancements, industry shifts, or regulatory changes that might necessitate updates.

### 10. **Feedback Loop**:
- Create a mechanism for team members to provide feedback or report issues related to the standard.
- Address feedback in a timely manner and make necessary adjustments.

### 11. **Documentation and Accessibility**:
- Ensure the standard is documented in a clear and concise manner.
- Make the documentation easily accessible to all relevant personnel.

### 12. **Communication**:
- Make sure to communicate any changes, updates, or revisions to the standard to all stakeholders.

### 13. **Review and Update**:
- Standards aren't set in stone. As technologies evolve and needs change, revisit and update the standard accordingly.

Remember, the ultimate goal of a technical standard is to ensure consistency, efficiency, and quality. It should be a living document that adapts to the changing needs and advancements of the organization or industry.
