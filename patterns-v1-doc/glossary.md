  You can optionally add a link to further information.

* Provide usage guidance -- Adding this guidance is optional although some feedback from 
social media suggests users like these details:

  * Capitalization.
  * First use vs. subsequent uses.
  * Approved and unapproved acronyms and abbreviations.
