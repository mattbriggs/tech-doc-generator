# Write {{pattern}} using {{implementation-name}}

Describe the purpose of the {{implementation-name}}.

The template instructions walks you through the steps to get the material you'll use to create a deliverable. The focus on the implementation is the parts of the deliverable and how to create each part.

With the source of information and materials, the writer collects the parts, puts them into the required order, and drafts the content. When the content is complete, the writer checks that the deliverable made from the
{{implementation-name}} provides the knowledge.
