Instructions: |
  Procedures, which are a set of steps that can be performed by one person 
  and that are always done the same way each time. For example: How to log 
  on to a computer, how to install Windows 2000. Procedures may be performed 
  in a linear sequence or may take the form of "Ifâ€¦Then". The key is that 
  the worker uses relatively little judgment when applying procedures since 
  the steps are fairly cut and dry.
