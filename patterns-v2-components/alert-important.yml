  Essential information required for user success.
  Alerts are a Markdown extension to create block quotes that render on Docs with colors and icons that indicate the significance of the content.

  Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. It's better to put that info directly into the article text.

  If you need to use alerts, limit them to one or two per article. Multiple notes should never be next to each other in an article.
